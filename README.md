> A GitHub App built with Probot that comments the gzipped sizes of your webpack assets and the changes since the last build into the relevant PR

## Usage
First add an instance of the plugin to your webpack configuration:

```diff
// webpack.config.js
+ const SizePlugin = require('size-plugin');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
+    new SizePlugin({writeToDisk:true})
  ]
}
```

Second Simply [install the app](https://github.com/apps/size-plugin) and watch the magic happen
